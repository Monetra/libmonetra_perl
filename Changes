Revision history for Perl module Monetra
0.9.4 Mon Nov 12 10:34:00 2012
    - Fix incompatibilies introduced in relation to calling M_Monitor
      directly.
0.9.3 Wed Jun 15 15:54:00 2011
    - Remove dead waits via M_uwait().  Instead we should wait during
      can_read() for the desired amount of sleep time.
    - Fix M_CompleteAuthorizations(), it should only return number of
      completed, not all in queue.
    - Fix M_DeleteTrans() it was undefining the value rather than
      deleting from the hash.

0.9.2 Tue Aug 10 14:43:00 2010
    - Attempt to be bug-compatible with old implementation. M_ResponseKeys()
      previously return an array reference rather than the array itself,
      change code to do the same in this native perl version.
    - Same for M_CompleteAuthorizations()

0.9.1 Fri Jun 18 16:48:01 2010
    - CSV parser should use M_explode_quoted, greatly simplifies code

0.9.0 Mon Mar 15 16:01:07 2010
    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.51
